  "summary": "Diff adds an Advanced Contact Lookup reporting UI (result-card action + dialog), offline cache usage in lookup, service worker precache for the public dataset, new i18n keys, and updates the production verification checklist. However, report submission appears to be implemented as a simulated localStorage-only flow rather than using the existing report submission dialog/submission mechanism, and category mapping to the existing report category model is not evidenced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-46",
      "requirement": "Use the existing report submission dialog flow to submit an anonymous report from Advanced Contact Lookup results.",
      "reason": "The diff introduces a new hook that explicitly simulates submission and stores reports in localStorage instead of using an existing report submission mechanism/flow. This does not match the requirement to use the existing report submission dialog flow.",

      "requirement": "Submit the selected tag using the existing report category model (mapping to existing categories where applicable), while showing only Spam/Phishing/Scam/Other.",
      "reason": "The dialog collects a string category ('Spam'|'Phishing'|'Scam'|'Other') and passes it through to submission, but the diff summary provides no evidence of mapping to the app’s existing report category types/model for compatibility.",

      "description": "Simulated report submission with artificial delay and persistence to localStorage under 'anonymous_reports'.",
