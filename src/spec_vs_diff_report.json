  "summary": "REQ-35, REQ-36, and REQ-37 appear implemented via production manifest/service-worker updates, finalized PWA install capture/trigger logic, and InstallButton i18n wiring. REQ-38 is not fully met because several locales are described as falling back to English rather than having complete translations. REQ-39 is partially met (new English checklist exists), but required items like an explicit reference to PWA_WEBAPK_ANDROID_TEST.md and a final pass/fail sign-off section are not evidenced in the truncated document content.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-38",
      "requirement": "Complete and integrate full multilingual translation set for EN, ES, FR, ZH, AR, RU with no missing UI keys and complete institutional page content per language.",
      "reason": "The diff evidence indicates French/Chinese/Arabic/Russian are using English fallback rather than complete locale objects derived from Portuguese, which violates the requirement for complete translations (and implies potential missing keys/content in those locales).",

        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (describes: \"French/Chinese/Arabic/Russian using English as fallback\")",

      "requirement": "Verification checklist must include a reference/link to existing frontend/PWA_WEBAPK_ANDROID_TEST.md and end with a clear pass/fail sign-off section.",
      "reason": "The newly added checklist file is truncated and the shown portion does not include a reference/link to frontend/PWA_WEBAPK_ANDROID_TEST.md, nor does it show a final pass/fail sign-off section. Because only truncated content is available, these required elements are not evidenced as implemented.",
