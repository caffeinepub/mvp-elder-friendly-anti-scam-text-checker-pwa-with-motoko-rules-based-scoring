  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented (5-language support + PT fallback, dropdown shows PT/EN/ES/FR/DE with native names and mobile code). Footer was updated and made responsive, but the diff is truncated, so the exact required references line and the full set of required official links (ENISA, CISA, CNCS, Europol) cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence. Some extra footer content (additional data source icons/links and Banco de Portugal link) was added beyond the request.",

      "reason": "Footer code is truncated right after starting the ENISA link; the required exact prefix text and the presence of *all* required links (especially CISA and Europol in the references line) cannot be confirmed from the diff summary. CNCS is shown elsewhere (Portuguese entities row), but that is not sufficient evidence that CNCS is also included in the required references line.",
