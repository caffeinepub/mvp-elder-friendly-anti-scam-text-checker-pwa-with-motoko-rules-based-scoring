  "summary": "Implemented transparency rendering in StructuredAnalysisResultCard (Public sources list + Collaborative basis statement) and extended the structured analysis model with `sources` and `collaborativeBasis`. Added i18n labels for transparency sections (file content truncated, but diff summary indicates keys exist). However, the diff does not provide evidence that all analyzers always return at least 2 valid https sources and a truthful collaborative-basis statement for every analysis output, nor that all new engine-generated user-facing strings are fully localized across all supported languages.",

      "id": "REQ-32",
      "requirement": "Ensure every analyzer output (message/email/phone/crypto) includes a non-empty (>=2) list of public, legal `https://` sources and a truthful collaborative-basis statement, with all new engine-generated user-facing strings localized for PT/EN/ES/FR/ZH/AR/RU.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the new types and UI rendering, but the analyzer implementations (`analyzeMessage`, `analyzeEmail`, `analyzePhone`, `analyzeCrypto`) and their returned `sources`/`collaborativeBasis` payloads are not visible in the provided truncated diff. Therefore there is no evidence that each analyzer always returns >=2 valid absolute `https://` URLs, nor that the collaborative-basis statement is correctly set per output, nor that all newly added engine strings are localized across all supported languages.",
